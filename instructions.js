But just try to get as many kills as possible. \n \nBtw you can also inspect the page (Ctrl+Shift+I/Cmd+Option+I) to try out some fun variables to make the game more interesting, the variables also work in multiplayer so you can show other people your crazy laser shooters.", {align: "center", wrap: 450*su})
